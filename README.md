# Tree Decomposition library

This is a library that's useful for doing tree decompositions. I have been
using these tools for my tool [Ganak](https://github.com/meelgroup/ganak/), but
I want to use it in more projects. Now it's a library.

# Notes

Basically, if you find a bug, it's likely been introduced by me. Just open an
issue and I'll fix.
